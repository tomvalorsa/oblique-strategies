# Oblique Strategies

![Oblique strategies page](./readme-img.png)

Deck of cards to draw from when you've hit a creative brick wall. Based on the [original set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt. This set leans more towards programming.

The pattern on the back of the cards was taken from [css3 patterns](http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/#weave) and was made by Jeroen Franse.
